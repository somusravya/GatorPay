# 🏃 Sprint 1 – Core Foundation & Authentication

Sprint Duration: Feb 3 – Feb 18, 2026  
Sprint Goal: Build authentication system, wallet management, and establish core frontend + backend architecture.

---

# 📌 1. Sprint Overview

Sprint 1 focused on building the foundational architecture of the GatorPay application.  
The goal was to create a secure, scalable, and production-ready system that supports authentication, wallet management, and a functional dashboard interface.

This sprint laid the groundwork for all future financial features such as bill payments, loans, peer-to-peer transfers, and analytics.

---

# 🎯 2. Sprint Objectives

The main objectives of Sprint 1 were:

- Implement secure Email/Password authentication
- Integrate Google OAuth login
- Implement JWT-based route protection
- Design database schema with auto-migration
- Build Wallet system with transactions
- Create responsive Angular frontend
- Establish clean backend–frontend communication
- Ensure atomic wallet operations using database transactions
- Deliver a functional dashboard with account overview

# 👥 3. User Stories

Below are the user stories planned for this sprint.

---

## 🔐 Authentication User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to register with email, password, and personal details so that I can create an account.

2. As a registered user, I want to login securely so that I can access my account dashboard.

3. As a user with a Google account, I want to authenticate using Google OAuth so I do not need to create a new password.

4. As a developer, I want to protect backend routes using JWT middleware so that only authenticated users can access secure APIs.

5. As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve my profile information so I can view my account details and wallet balance.

---

## 💰 Wallet User Stories

6. As a newly registered user, I want a wallet created automatically so that I can start using financial features immediately.

7. As a user, I want to add money to my wallet so that I can fund my account.

8. As a user, I want to withdraw money securely so that I can access my funds.

9. As a user, I want transactions to be recorded so that I can track my financial history.

---

## 🗄 Database & Backend Architecture Stories

10. As a developer, I want automatic database migration so that schema updates are applied during startup.

11. As a developer, I want well-defined models (User, Wallet, Transaction) so that the system is structured and scalable.

12. As a developer, I want soft delete support to prevent permanent data loss.

---

## 🎨 Frontend User Stories

13. As a user, I want a clean and responsive login page.

14. As a user, I want a registration page with validation.

15. As a developer, I want a centralized AuthService to manage authentication state.

16. As a developer, I want route guards to prevent unauthorized access.

17. As a developer, I want an HTTP interceptor to automatically attach JWT tokens.

18. As a user, I want a dashboard that shows my balance, KYC status, and recent transactions.

19. As a user, I want quick action buttons to easily access wallet features.
